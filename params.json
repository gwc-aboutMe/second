My name is Elizabeth Bartusiak. My favorite colors are orange and yellow because they are so bright and happy! Something you would not guess by looking at me is that I love to play basketball. Consequently, I am also a big fan of the Chicago Bulls. I play the violin and love to practice often. Last year, I even played for a wedding! Aside from running on the basketball court and making music, I love math. To me, math is like solving complex problems using nothing but a little bit of hope and a lot of shear logic! In the future, you will find me working with computer science to protect other people's cyber-security.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my rendition of a painting by Jackson Pollock:\r\n\r\n![](https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/11825971_1433011730362531_1447994703077333653_n.jpg?oh=9c51179499e03a1aa47b11a9185de2ee&oe=564C3400)\r\n\r\nMr. Pollock likes this painting!
