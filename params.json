My name is Elizabeth Bartusiak. My favorite colors are orange and yellow because they are so bright and happy! Something you would not guess by looking at me is that I love to play basketball. Consequently, I am also a big fan of the Chicago Bulls. I play the violin and love to practice often. Last year, I even played for a wedding! Aside from running on the basketball court and making music, I love math. To me, math is like solving complex problems using nothing but a little bit of hope and a lot of shear logic! In the future, you will find me working with computer science to protect other people's cyber-security.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/kembray-elizabeth-pollick/4715211081777152\">Kembray-Elizabeth Pollick</a></h2> <script src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/kembray-elizabeth-pollick/4715211081777152/embed.js?editor=no&amp;buttons=yes&amp;author=yes&amp;embed=yes\"></script> <p>Made using: <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming\">Khan Academy Computer Science</a>.</p> \r\n[Back to top](http://gwc-aboutme.github.io/second/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
